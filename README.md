# Small Gopher Applets

These are little scripts I run on my server that I feel are so small they don't
merit an entire repository, like [Gopherspace RPG](https://github.com/someodd/grpg).

## Script/Program Format

I made a standard/format for small, contained scripts and binaries:

  * README/Markdown format
  * No other files--everything (documentation and the code) is contained within one markdown file
  * Literate Haskell
  * Can be executed as a script *or* compiled
  * Hopefully no real dependencies (beyond say, GHC)
